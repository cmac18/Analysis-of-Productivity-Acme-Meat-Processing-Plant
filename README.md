# Six-Sigma / a Class Project
Abstract

This paper will apply the Six Sigma DMAIC process the production of single cuts of meat produced for a national grocery. The production facility has not produced the quantity or quality of cuts to the customerâ€™s specs. The production facility has not made a profit wither and has been in business for one year. Using the DMAIC process, I intend to define, measure, analyses the processes failing and then improve and control the process.
